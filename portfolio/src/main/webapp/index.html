		<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> Hello! My name is Andrew Li, 
		and I'm a rising sophomore at the University of Wisconsin Madison. I like playing
      games, playing the piano, and coding things. I also like what the internet calls "trolling
      around", and admittedly I go a bit too far sometimes in that respect. I was born in Hinsdale, 
      Illinois. My family and I used to live in a small apartment at the time, but when I was 1 we 
      moved to a larger house in Aurora, IL, which is where I will be working from
      this summer!<br/><br/> I have a twin brother and a sister. Their names  are
      Justin and Cathy. Justin is a mischievous guy, prone to sudden fanboy attacks
      and lots of "harmless" pranks. His biggest love in life is his anime, and there is quite
      literally nothing that can stop him from getting his hands on them. My sister, on the other 
      hand, is calmer and more composed. She likes playing the piano, learning how to play new 
      instruments, and playing games with her dear brothers. Oh, and gardening. From jalapenos to
      parsley, she knows how to grow it all. She currently works as a software engineer at Google, 
      which was how I originally got the inspiration to intern at Google this summer.</p>
